# Location Finder For Opening New Restaurant (May-June 2021)
* My Aim was to find an optimal location for opening a new Punjabi restaurant, near CP, New Delhi.
* I collected venues data nearby the CP, New Delhi by using Reverse Geopy geocoding, Four Square
* API and categorize them by various matrices and visualize them by using Folium.
* Then by using K-Means clustering, I made 15 zones of the locations, and by using Geopy I was able
to get 15 addresses with a low number of restaurants and no Punjabi restaurants nearby , all
zones being fairly close to CP, Delhi.
